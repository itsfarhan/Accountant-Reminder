# Accountant-Reminder
Lets say there is an accountant who has clients that file ITR and sometimes misses to provide invoice for particular transaction/spending. This would require accountant to do more work and get invoice to attach again. But I have built a java program that would let clients to upload invoices and accountant can send notification through email.
